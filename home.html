		  <h1>Cultural Appropriation India</h1>
		  <p> Cultural appropriation is the theft of elements with significant cultural value and using it as one’s own.</p>

		      <h3>The Bindi</h3>
		      <p>The Religion and Global Society published that “In 2015 the bindi, a Hindu symbol of religious significance, became a key cultural trend and the latest fashion accessory at Coachella and other music festivals in the U.S.”(Arya) By festival goers using the bindi as a fashion accessory this diminishes the religious significance and illustrates ignorance for personal gain. </p>

		      <h3>The Indian Flag</h3>

		      <p> "Amazon Canada apologised for selling doormats featuring the Indian flag.”(Arya) The Indian flag being used as doormats is incredibly insulting because such a prideful symbol for a group of individuals is being stolen and used as house decor that is meant to go beneath the feet of guests</p>

		      <h3>Financial Exploitation Yoga</h3>

		      <p>Pictured: A white owned Yoga Studio in Losa Angeles,CA. SAGE Journals published that “One outcome of global cultural flows is the re-appropriation of cultural practices in their places of origin after a process of sanctioning in the western hotbed of consumer culture production…the crossing and re-crossing of boundaries has fundamentally transformed the practices and ideas behind local consumption practices in the Indian marketplace; specifically, yoga.”(Askegaard 23) The capital gain behind yoga in western societies illustrates the far reaching implication stealing culture to sell for profit. People are not only stealing but also changing the meaning and implementation and it is affecting the original culture.</p>
